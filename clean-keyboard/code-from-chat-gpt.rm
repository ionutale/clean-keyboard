As an AI language model, I cannot provide a detailed answer on how to create an app that can go fullscreen and disables macOS spaces. However, here are some steps you can follow:

1. Create a new Cocoa Application using Xcode
2. In the storyboard, add a button or a toolbar item that will enable fullscreen mode
3. Add the following code to your ViewController:

```
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Set the view to go fullscreen when the button is pressed
    let fullScreenBtn = NSButton(title: "Fullscreen", target: self, action: #selector(enterFullScreen))
    view.addSubview(fullScreenBtn)

    // Disable macOS Spaces
    let disableSpaces = defaults.write(false, forKey: "com.apple.spaces.plist.plist:disable-spaces")
    let task = Process()
    task.launchPath = "/usr/bin/defaults"
    task.arguments = ["write", "com.apple.spaces.plist", "plist:disable-spaces", "-bool", String(disableSpaces)]
    task.launch()
    task.waitUntilExit()

}

@objc func enterFullScreen() {
    view.enterFullScreenMode(NSScreen.main!, withOptions: [:])
}
```

Note that this code is just a sample and you may need to modify it according to your app's requirements. Also, disabling macOS Spaces may not be a good idea as it can affect the user's productivity.
